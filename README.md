   ## <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/nDmTGama5e9ZH6mlT3/giphy.gif" width="30px"> Introduction :
  The project's main objective is to create a classification system
for fruits based on their different characteristics, including colour,
shape, and texture. Users may upload images of different fruits to
this site, which are subsequently processed by a trained
algorithm. The computer looks at the image and calculates the
nutritional value of the fruits, such as their sugar, fibre, protein,
and calorie content.

## <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/nDmTGama5e9ZH6mlT3/giphy.gif" width="30px"> Project Objectives: 
        1. Preprocess the images.

        2. Applying the CNN algorithm to the dataset.

        3. How deep neural networks detect the disease.

        4. You will be able to know how to find the accuracy of the model.

        5. You will be able to build web applications using the Flask framework.   
## <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/nDmTGama5e9ZH6mlT3/giphy.gif" width="30px"> Project Flow :
- A web Application is built  where;
    - Farmers can interact with the portal build
    - Interacts with the user interface to upload images of diseased leaf
    - Our model built analyses the Disease and suggests the farmer with fertilizers are to be used 
- To accomplish the above task you must complete the below activities and tasks;
    - Download the dataset.
    - Classify the dataset into train and test sets.
    - Add the neural network layers.
    - Load the trained images and fit the model. 
    - Test the model.
    - Save the model and its dependencies.
    - Build a Web application using a flask that integrates with the model built.

## Anaconda Navigator :
- Anaconda Navigator is a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for data science and machine learning-related applications. It can be installed on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Conda is an open-source, cross-platform,  package management system. Anaconda comes with so very nice tools like JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook,QtConsole, Spyder, Glueviz, Orange, Rstudio, Visual Studio Code. For this project, we will be using Jupiter notebook and spyder.To install Anaconda navigator and to know how to use Jupyter Notebook a Spyder using Anaconda watch the video given here.

 ### To build Deep learning models you must require the following packages :
 - Tensor flow: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers can easily build and deploy ML powered applications.
 - Keras : Keras leverages various optimization techniques to make high level neural network API easier and more performant. It supports the following features.
 
       1. Consistent, simple and extensible API.
       
       2. Minimal structure - easy to achieve the result without any frills.
       
       3. It supports multiple platforms and backends.
       
       4. It is user-friendly framework that runs on both CPU and GPU.
       
       5. Highly scalability of computation.
 - Flask: Web framework used for building  Web applications.Watch the given below video to Install the necessary Packages.

 - The dataset folder contains two folders contains a test and train folder, each of them have images of different fruits.
- The Flask folder has all the files necessary to build the flask application. 

     -  Templates folder has the HTML pages.
  
     -  Uploads folder has the uploads made by the user.
  
     -  app.py is the python script for server-side computing.
  
     - .h5 files are the model files that are to be saved after model building.
